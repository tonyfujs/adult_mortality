This project download raw data from the Human Life Table Database, and formats
it for upload in DCS

All data comes from the [HLT database](https://www.mortality.org/)
Unfortunately, downloading from their site is kind of tricky (some WB security 
issues, or lack of support for modern browser or something...). 
Emi downloaded the file on her personal laptop, and sent them to me via email.

## TO DO
Check with Emi how to download files programmatically
